# Study guide for midterm 2

The midterm is cumulative but will focus more on topics covered after midterm 1. Be sure to thoroughly review material from Weeks 3 -7

1. Pointers: 
   * Declarion and initialization for pointers to different data types
   * Pointers and arrays (similarities and differences)
   * Pointer arithmetic
   * Pointers to pointers
   * Pointers to structs
   * Debugging exercises with pointers

2. Arrays and Structs
   * Declaration, initialization
   * Passing arrays to functions
   * Basic data structures that use structs, array lists
   * Debugging exercises involving arrays and structs (implications of out of bound array access) 
  

3. Program and data representation in memory
   * Program layout- text, data, bss, heap and stack
   * Data layout in memory: pointers, structs, arrays of chars, shorts, ints, pointers, structs
   * Byte ordering (little and big endian)
  
4. Dynamic memory allocation
   * malloc, calloc, realloc, free
   * Identifying the causes for segfaults, memory leaks, dangling pointers and data corruption
   * Debugging exercises 
  
5. File IO
   * Streams
   * Functions to interact with files: fopen, fputc, fgetc, fread, fwrite, fclose, feof
   * Data representation in files
  
5. Hand compiling C code to ARM  with emphasis on the following ARM instructions
   * ARM Data transfer instructions for interaction with memory
   * ARM Control transfer instructions (if , if else, while, do ..while)
   * Conditional execution of ARM instructions using condition codes
   * Function call mechanics and the ARM Procedure call standard
   * Nested functions
