The midterm will cover topics from Weeks 1 to 3 which includes:

1. Number representation: 

	* Encoding with fixed and finite number of bits
	* unsigned, signed, hex, decimal
	* fixed point and floating point: understand the tradeoffs
	* conversion between different bases
	* sign extension
	* range of values that can be represented with finite numbers of bits and any given representation
	* binary arithmetic - addition, subtraction
	* overflow - when does it occur for signed and unsigned numbers, how to detect it

2. ARM Instruction set architecture
	* Registers - size, usage in ARM instructions
	* Arithmetic and bitwise instructions
	* ARM shifts and rotates
	* Hand compiling C to ARM code

3. C Concepts
	* Bitwise and logical operators
	* Bit manipulations 
	* C pointers 
	* C arrays and pointer arithmetic
