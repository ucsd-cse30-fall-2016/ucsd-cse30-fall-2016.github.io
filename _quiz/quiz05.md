#Instructions
Before beginning this quiz, it is highly recommended that you read the write-up for PA3. The questions on the quiz are related to your understanding of what you are expected to do in PA3.

Assume that encodeChar, decodeChar, implantBit, extractBit, textToBinary, binaryToCode, codeToBinary, binaryToText, encodeFile, decodeFile, reorder_bytes, and char_freqs refer to the corresponding functions you are asked to implement in PA3. Also assume the indexing conventions are the same as in the Lab03 write-up.
