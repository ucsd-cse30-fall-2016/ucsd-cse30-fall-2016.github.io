# Quiz 2 instructions


* This quiz is based on the [week 2 assigned reading](/lectures/week2/) with emphasis on bitwise operations in ARM Assembly and C. We also assume you know the material from week 1. So, expect questions on number representation.
* You get two attempts on the quiz. However, you do not have the option of saving your attempts for later. You must complete each attempt in a single sitting. The best score will be used. Correct answers and feedback will be provided after the due date.
* The quiz is not timed, expected time to complete the quiz is under 45 minutes 
* Assume that char is 1 byte, unless otherwise stated. 
* Assume that, for single precision floating point numbers, you are using IEEE 754 floating point standard for single precision (32 bit) floating point numbers, unless otherwise stated.
* Assume that >> is implemented as an arithmetic right shift by the compiler.
