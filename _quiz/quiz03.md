# Quiz 3 instructions

* This quiz is based on the [weeks 3 assigned reading](/lectures/week3/) with emphasis on bitwise operations in ARM Assembly and C and pointer basics. We also assume you know the material from previous weeks. 
* You get two attempts on the quiz. However, you do not have the option of saving your attempts for later. The best score will be used. You must complete each attempt in a single sitting. Correct answers and feedback will be provided after the due date.
* The quiz is not timed, expected time to complete the quiz is under 30 minutes. Taking longe than that may result in the expiration of your login session.
* Assume that char is 1 byte, unless otherwise stated. 
* Unless otherwise stated, assume that int, signed int, and unsigned int are 4 bytes. Assume all signed numbers use 2's complement representation.
* Assume that >> is implemented as an arithmetic right shift by the compiler.
