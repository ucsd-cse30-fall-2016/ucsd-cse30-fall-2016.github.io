## Lab 01: Data Lab

The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with
bit-level representations of integers and floating point numbers.
You'll do this by solving a series of programming ``puzzles.'' Many of
these puzzles are quite artificial, but you'll find yourself thinking
much more about bits in working your way through them.

All the information needed to begin this lab is available in the [lab 01 writeup](/lab/lab01/datalab.pdf)
