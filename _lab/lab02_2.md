## Lab 02: Array list Lab (ARM part)

This is an assignment in two parts. In the first part you are given more practice with GDB, the GNU Project Debugger and a lot of practice with pointers by writing C code that uses them heavily.
The second part of the assignment focusses on translating your C code to Assembly. After completing the assignment you should know many of the important ARM instructions (particularly those that interact with memory) and understand what goes on under the hood of your C program.


Deadline for part I (C part): 11-01-2016 @ 11:59pm
Deadline for part II (ARM part): 11-10-2016 @ 11:59pm
