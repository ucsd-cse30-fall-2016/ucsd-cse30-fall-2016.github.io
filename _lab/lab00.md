## Introduction

This lab consists of a checklist that must be completed before you can attempt subsequent assignments. All parts of this lab must be done individually. The lab constitutes 2% of your total grade.

## Sign the Academic Integrity Form 

Understand what constitutes an Academic Integrity (AI) violation by reading and electronically signing the [Academic Integrity Form for CSE 30](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexDFQsfQF4rWichJcwT-PNzkLSR1Y7BqcVJMvUNn0etaecQQ/viewform)

## Register your iclicker

Register your iclicker on the [iclicker website](https://www1.iclicker.com/register-clicker/). Store a screen shot of your successful registration with a date to be submitted with lab-1.

## Set up your github account and environment

* Step 1: Read a brief introduction to github and an explanation of the terms that we will be using often [here](/topics/github_introduction/) 

* Step 2: Understand the process of submitting your PA. You will be required to complete all programming assignments on github. A successful submission entails pushing your code to github **AND** submitting it to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) for autograding. If you are working in a pair, you should have a single repo on github on which both students are collaborators and you should also submit a single version of the code on github

* Step 3: Create your github account following [the git setup tutorial](/topics/github_setup/). Please read the instructions even if you already have a github account

* Step 4: Perform one-time git configurations on your emulated/physical Raspberry Pi machine. If you don't have a Pi yet and don't have an emulation environment with docker, return to this step later. If you have that set up already, follow [the git one-time configuration tutorial](/topics/git_one_time_config/)

## Understand the guidelines for pair programming

* Step 1: Read the guidelines for pair programming in this class and watch a related video in this tutorial on [pair programming for CSE 30](/topics/pair_programming/)

* Step 2: If you wish to work with a partner, select one before this assignment is due. You may only pair with students **ENROLLED** in the same section as you. If you are on the waitlist, you may pair with another waitlist student who is around the same position as you are.

## Set up a raspberry pi emulation environment

Even if you plan to use the actual hardware, you must have a working setup to emulate the Raspberry Pi. This will serve as backup in case something goes wrong with your hardware or an unfortunate breakup takes place between you and your partner!

You can either setup your own laptop OR run everything on the cloud.
Choose one the tutorials below to set up an emulation environment on your laptop:

* [Tutorial on emulating RPi on MAC OSX or Linux](/topics/rpi-emulate-mac-linux/)
* [Tutorial on emulating RPi on Windows](/topics/rpi-emulate-windows/)

## Complete the response form for this lab to get credit

Link to the form is available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5O3_oe-KQ9ETJI0RKAhqy-6-_Jo6Jia38vmMf4RKHaytp-Q/viewform)

Note that other than the question regarding whether you will be working with a partner or not, you must respond positively to all other multiple choice questions to get full credit on this lab. Seek help during this week's lab hours if you are unable to complete any part of the lab.
