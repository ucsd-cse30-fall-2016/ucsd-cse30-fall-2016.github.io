# Course Policies

## Academic Integrity

Each student is responsible for knowing and abiding by UCSD's policies on Integrity of Scholarship and the Jacobs School Student Honor Code. Any student violating UCSD's Academic Dishonesty or UCSD's Student Conduct policies will earn an 'F' in the course and will be reported to their college Dean for administrative processing. Committing acts that violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are cause for suspension or dismissal from UCSD.

## Collaboration

Students are encouraged to talk to each other, to the course staff, or to anyone else about any of the assignments. Assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write out his or her own solutions to written component of homeworks, programming assignments may be completed with a partner.
